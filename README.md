Jupyter Notebook files for analyzing XPCS data and generating figures. Vector graphic figures (`.pdf`) generated from Jupyter Notebooks are used directly in *Overleaf* manuscript without any further scaling or editing.

#### ./Analysis/Plot_SAXS.ipynb
* Generates stacked SAXS 1D and SAXS 2D figure (Fig. 2)

#### ./Analysis/Plot_g2_tauQ.ipynb
* Generates g<sub>2</sub> vs. τ and τ<sub>0</sub>(Q) vs. Q figure for Sample A (Fig. 3)

#### ./Analysis/Plot_tauQ_AllSamples.ipynb
* Generates τ<sub>0</sub>(Q) vs. Q figure for Sample A, B and C (Fig. 4)

#### ./Reduced_Data
* Contains data for replotting the figures in the main manuscript
